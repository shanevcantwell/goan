1. Complete the Resume File Handler
The entry point for resuming a task, workspace.handle_file_drop, is currently incomplete. It needs to be finished to correctly process .goan_resume files.

Unpack the Archive: The function must fully unzip the .goan_resume file into a temporary directory.
Load Parameters: It needs to read params.json from the archive and use the _apply_settings_dict_to_ui helper to populate all the creative UI controls.
Load Source Image: It must load source_image.png and display it in the INPUT_IMAGE_DISPLAY.
Persist Latent State: The path to the extracted latent_history.pt needs to be saved into the RESUME_LATENT_PATH_STATE so it can be passed to the worker when the task is added to the queue.
Update UI Labels: Implement the logic to dynamically change the VIDEO_LENGTH_SLIDER slider's label to "Additional Video Length (s)" to provide clear user feedback.
2. Implement the Agent-Driven Pause Logic
The current ProcessingAgent only handles "start" and "stop". The crucial "pause" orchestration is missing.

Modify the Worker (generation_core.py):

The try...except (InterruptedError, KeyboardInterrupt) block needs to be updated. When an interruption occurs, it must push a new message, like ('interrupted_with_state', (task_id, history_latents_for_abort)), to the output_queue_ref before it sends the final ('aborted', ...) signal. This provides the agent with the necessary data to save the state.
Enhance the Agent (agents.py):

Add a _handle_pause method that sets an internal self.pause_requested = True flag and then sets the global interrupt_flag.
In the _processing_loop, after receiving the 'aborted' signal from the worker, check if self.pause_requested is True.
If it is, the agent must take the history_latents it received from the 'interrupted_with_state' message and call generation_utils.save_resume_state() to create the .goan_resume file.
After saving, the agent should push a new ('paused', (task_id, path_to_resume_file)) message to the ui_update_queue.
3. Wire the Resume State into the Queue and Worker
The UI needs to pass the resume information to the backend, and the backend needs to use it.

Update Queue Logic (queue.py and switchboard_queue.py):

The add_or_update_task_in_queue function must be modified to accept resume_latent_path as an input.
The switchboard must be updated to pass the RESUME_LATENT_PATH_STATE component as an input to this function.
When a task is created, if resume_latent_path is present, it must be added to the task's parameter dictionary.
The add_task_outputs in the switchboard must include RESUME_LATENT_PATH_STATE so it can be cleared (gr.update(value=None)) after the task is added.
Update Worker Logic (generation_core.py):

At the beginning of the worker function, it must check if the resume_latent_path parameter is valid.
If it is, instead of initializing history_latents as an empty tensor, it must load the tensor from the file using torch.load().
It should then perform an initial VAE decode on the loaded latents to populate history_pixels for seamless blending on the first new segment.
4. Finalize the UI Feedback Loop
The UI needs to react to the new "paused" event from the agent.

Update the UI Listener (queue_processing.py):

The process_task_queue_and_listen generator loop needs a new elif flag == "paused": condition.
When this event is received, it should yield an update to the hidden RESUME_DOWNLOADER_UI component, setting its value to the path of the .goan_resume file.
Update the Switchboard (switchboard_queue.py):

The process_q_outputs list must be updated to include components[K.RESUME_DOWNLOADER_UI] as its first output, so it can receive the update from the listener.
A .then() call with a JavaScript function (js="() => { ... }) must be added to the PROCESS_QUEUE_BUTTON's click chain to programmatically click the hidden download link, triggering the browser download.
5. Refactor Legacy "Abort" Terminology
Replace all uses of "abort" (e.g., variable names, log messages, function names like _signal_abort_to_ui) with "pause" or "paused" where the intent is to support resumable interruption.
Ensure worker() and agent logic use "paused_with_state" for user-initiated, resumable interruptions.
Update UI and queue status labels to reflect "Paused" instead of "Aborted".
Remove or clarify any remaining references to "abort" that refer to non-resumable cancellation, if such a state is not needed.
Completing these five areas will result in a fully functional, robust, and user-friendly pause and resume system that matches the architecture described in the design documents.
